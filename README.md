# PyANSYS

## Objectives

This code allows the user to communicates with Ansys by the use of his own python code using, the pyAnsys modules. 
It can for example be used to work on parametric studies.

## Description of the code structure

The code is divided in 3 main modules :
* extract_result_ansys : to extract the results from a solved ansys model 
* analyse_result_ansys : to store and analyse the result in adapted classes
* launch_ansys_simulation : to launch a parametric simulation from a template input .mac
